# Probabilistic Transcriptome-wide Association Analysis (PTWAS)

This repository contains the software implementations and necessary annotation resources for a suite of statistical methods to perform transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS). These methods are designed to perform rigorous causal inference connecting genes to complex traits. The statistical models and the key algorithms are described in the manuscript [\[1\]](https://biorxiv.org/).

The repository includes source code, scripts and necessary data to replicate the results described in the manuscript. A detailed tutorial to guide the users through some specific analysis tasks is also included.

For questions/comments regarding to the software package, please contact Xiaoquan (William) Wen (xwen at umich dot edu).
